### Measuring Inter Focal Distances in spermatocyte Spreads


#### Discription of Data
Measures of IFD from ~100 F2 mice from Cast X PWD cross.
Measures of IFD from PWD and CAST spermatocytes.

correlations to examine:
- proportion of CO classes (per mouse) 
- range of proportion classes
- mean and variation of IFD
- histogram of IFD
- min value per F2 mouse
- normalized IFD **
- relationsihp of total SC and CO number

Null Expectations without Interference
-Compare mu and var (mean and variance). Under a Poission distribution, these should be the same. Deviation from this relationship could be a measure of interference. 

Questions
*Why would PWD have longer IFD than Cast?*
Total SC area expands in PWD compared to CAST. 

*Why would there be a negative correlation betweeen IFD and proportion of 2COs?* 
-Shorter bivs become slightly longer, allowing state change from 1CO -> 2CO. (biv Length)
-Weaker interference allows stat change of short bivs from 1CO -> 2CO. (%IFD)
To distinguish the above 2 scnarios, requires the comparison of biv length and %IFD. 

* requires SC length measures
